### REST:
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an API that defines a set of functions that programmers can use to send requests and 
receive responses using the HTTP protocol methods such as GET and POST.




### REST api vs RESTful api:
"REST API" is a broader term that could refer to any API that uses the principles of REST, but it might not adhere to all the principles strictly.

"RESTful API" specifically refers to an API that strictly follows the principles of REST.


Headers provide additional information about the request or response and help in controlling the behavior of the communication between the client 
and the server.
